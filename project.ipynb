       "| Gender details about licence holders from other countries (such as Northern Ireland) are reliant upon information being captured accurately at the time of booking a test. In some cases, gender will not have been captured. Where a gender has not been captured these candidates will be recorded in total tests conducted there will therefore be small anomalies where the totals of gender do not match overall totals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | NA                                                                                                    |\n",

       "11 Low numbers within a particular data set must be treated with caution as they may not fully reflect the candidate characteristics being reported upon; any conclusions drawn will therefore not be statistically robust or reliable for any form of analysis or comparison e.g. comparing performance of a test centre where less than 100 tests were conducted against a test centre where over 1,000 were conducted.  In some cases, the information supplied for each test centre will not show the full range of data available as it has been withheld to prevent the identification of individuals and this should also be considered when making any comparative analysis. If there is a risk of any information being linked to an individual, this information has been withheld and is indicated by <U+2018>..<U+2019>.
